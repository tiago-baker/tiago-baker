Hi, I’m Tiago from Canada. I enjoy coding in TypeScript using MakeCode for microbits, where I create programs and experiment with different features. I have a strong interest in electronics and enjoy building, fixing, and troubleshooting devices such as computers and even broken ones I repaired.
In my free time, I like working with computer hardware and learning how different parts function together. I also enjoy installing and setting up operating systems on computers, including various versions of Windows and Linux. I’m always looking to improve my skills through my projects and experiments.
